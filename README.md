# Anomaly-Detection

# Project Title
	Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection
 

# Project Description:
	**bold text** Your task is to develop a Python script capable of detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. This stream, simulating real-time sequences of floating-point numbers, could represent various metrics such as financial transactions or system metrics. Your focus will be on identifying unusual patterns, such as exceptionally high values or deviations from the norm.

## Objectives:
## Algorithm Selection: 
The Isolation Forest algorithm is implemented in model.py.
This algorithm is well-suited for anomaly detection particularly in high-dimensional datasets and can adapt to concept drift by retraining periodically as new data arrives.

## Data Stream Simulation: 
Enhancing the anomaly_detect.py file by adding a function that simulates a data stream with regular patterns , seasonal elements, and random noise.
#
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def generate_data_stream(num_points=1000, seasonality=50, noise_level=0.1):
    time = np.arange(num_points)
    seasonal_pattern = np.sin(2 * np.pi * time / seasonality)  # Seasonal pattern
    noise = np.random.normal(0, noise_level, num_points)  # Random noise
    data_stream = seasonal_pattern + noise
    return pd.Series(data_stream)

## Anomaly Detection:
Generated data stream and flag anomalies can be successfully finding out in real time.

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import logging
import time

# Initialize logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='anomaly.log', level=logging.INFO)

def anomaly_dect():
    # Load or train the Isolation Forest model here if necessary
    model = load('isolation_forest.joblib')
    
    # Simulate a data stream
    data_stream = generate_data_stream()
    
    for value in data_stream:
        # Reshape value for prediction
        prediction = model.predict([[value]])
        
        if prediction == -1:  # Anomaly detected
            logging.info(f'Anomaly detected: {value}')
        
        # Optionally visualize here if VISUALIZATION is enabled
        
        time.sleep(DELAY)  # Delay between iterations for real-time simulation


## Optimization: 

# Speed and Efficiency
# Batch Processing: Instead of checking each point individually, we are  accumulating a batch of points and then perform predictions on that batch to improve efficiency.

# Model Retraining: Implementing logic to retrain the model periodically (e.g., every N iterations or after receiving a certain amount of new data) to ensure it adapts to any concept drift.

# Memory Management: Using  a sliding window approach to keep only the most recent data points for training and predictions.

## Visualization: .
RealTime Visualization Tool:

We are enhancing the visualizing capabilities by integrating Matplotlib directly into the anomaly detection loop.


## Requirements:
The project must be implemented using Python 3.x.
Your code should be thoroughly documented, with comments to explain key sections.
Include a concise explanation of your chosen algorithm and its effectiveness.
Ensure robust error handling and data validation.
Limit the use of external libraries. If necessary, include a requirements.txt file.
