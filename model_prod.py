"""
Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest

This script defines and trains an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection 
using the scikit-learn library. The Isolation Forest algorithm is particularly 
effective for identifying outliers in high-dimensional datasets.

### Overview
In this code, we will:
1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Generate synthetic training data.
3. Train an Isolation Forest model on this data.
4. Save the trained model to a file for future use.

### Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: A powerful library for numerical operations in Python, which we use to generate random data.
- **scikit-learn**: Specifically, we utilize the `IsolationForest` class from this library to build our anomaly detection model.
- **joblib**: This library is employed to save the trained model to disk, allowing us to reuse it without needing to retrain.

    Train an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection.

    This function generates synthetic training data, fits an Isolation Forest 
    model to the data, and saves the trained model to a file. The random number 
    generator is seeded for reproducibility, ensuring consistent results across runs.

    Steps:
    1. Create a random number generator with a fixed seed.
    2. Generate synthetic training data by adding noise to a centered distribution.
    3. Fit the Isolation Forest model with specified parameters.
    4. Save the trained model using joblib.

    Returns:
        None
